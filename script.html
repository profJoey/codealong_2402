<!-- Test comment --> {
    More than one way to achieve your goal
    Depends on context and preference

}
<!-- how to code-along -->
 {
    Today I'm going to move
    I'll tell you when to copy the code
 }
<!-- auto -->
 {
    [OPEN] project code and live site]
    [TAB] Code
    Size calculated by width and height
    The default width is auto 
    Width set to auto takes available room
    Default height auto
    Height set to auto fits content
}
<!-- box model -->
 {
    Every element in web design is a rectangle
    Even elements that don't look like it (circle, text)
    Called "Box Model"
    Width = width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left + border-right
    Height = height + padding-top + padding-bottom + border-top + border-bottom
    [TAB] Live site > Inspector > Computed
    See Box Model in Inspector
 }
 <!-- relative sizing -->
  {
    Only demonstration, don't code along
    Say I want my site to be take up the entire browser screen
    Called the viewport
    I can't predict what size screen
    So I don't use pixels
    I use relative sizing
    Example = 100vh;
    Stands for 100% of the viewport height
    <style>
        body {
            height: 100vw;
        }
    </style>
    Scroll bar means site height exeeds viewports
    Back to box model
    Size is not just the element
    Includes margins, padding, border size
    <style>
        body {
            box-sizing: border-box;
        }
    </style>
    "border-box" value means size will include padding, border
    margins I have to subtract from my height
    <style>
        body {
            height: calc(100vh - 40px);
        }
    </style>
  }
<!-- flow layout --> {
    This project, I want my content to dictate height
    <style>
        body {
            height: auto;
        }
    </style>
    Let's create some content
    <header></header>        
    <nav>
    </nav>
    <main>
        <section>1</section>
        <section>2</section>
        <section>3</section>
        <section>4</section>
    </main>
    <footer></footer>
    header, nav, main section - semantic html
    not unlike divs, but come with extra meaning
    important for accessibility
    This is our basic page structure.

<!-- CSS Grid --> {
    rows and columns
    {display: grid}
    default = 1 column; 1 row / child
